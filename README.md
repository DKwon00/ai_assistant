# README

Hello,

Juni-AI is built to provide answers to users with questions about certain video games. Currently, the library is Minecraft, Terraria, and Fortnite. Will look to continue updating the list of libraries. 
The main functionality of this web application is to query ChatGPT with up-to-date information about video games and to also specify the information the chatbot draws from. 
The project depends on the ChatGPT API, and uses Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend. Most animations on the site use the Framer Motion library.
